# Skenion SDK

TypeScript SDK for Skenion node authoring, runtime connections, transport
lifecycle, command APIs, and capability negotiation.

The SDK is UI-framework agnostic and does not depend on React or Mantine.

## Initial Surface

The first SDK surface focuses on node definition manifests:

- `defineNode()` creates normalized v0.1 node definition manifests.
- `t.*` builders create canonical `flow + dataKind + constraints` port types.
- generated manifests are validated through `@skenion/contracts`.
- script lifecycle typing exposes only `onInit`, `onInput`, `onEvent`, and
  `onDispose`.

Canonical examples:

```ts
import { defineNode, t } from "@skenion/sdk";

const node = defineNode({
  id: "script.brightness",
  version: "0.1.0",
  displayName: "Brightness",
  category: "Script",
  ports: [
    {
      id: "enabled",
      direction: "input",
      type: t.value(t.bool()),
      activation: "latched",
      default: true
    },
    {
      id: "pulse",
      direction: "output",
      type: t.event(t.bang())
    }
  ],
  execution: {
    model: "script_control"
  },
  state: {
    persistent: true
  },
  capabilities: ["script.api.v0.1"],
  scriptApiVersion: "0.1.0"
});
```

`t.bool()` emits `dataKind: "boolean"`. GPU textures are resources:
`t.gpu.texture2d()` emits `flow: "resource"` and
`dataKind: "gpu.texture2d"`.
